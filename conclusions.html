                <h2>Conclusions & Learning</h2>
                <p>Throughout this project, we learned a lot about team development on an app and how to utilize Android Studio. We all
                    equally contributed to the project, with people specifically targetting their strengths such as databases or layout
                    work when we divied up the work for different sprints. One challenge we dealt with throughout the project was keeping
                    to deadlines, as we ended up keeping work until the last minuted sometimes. However, we learned to split up the work
                    into smaller parts and to complete these parts over time as to not overwhelm ourselves with work at the end of each
                    sprint. We learned a lot about working together and helping each other when necessary, and knowing when to cover each
                    other on certain tasks if someone couldn't finish something or didn't know how to. Balancing all the work was hard,
                    but with contributions from each team member we made it through and completed the app properly.
